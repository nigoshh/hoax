## database structure

![database diagram](https://github.com/nigoshh/hoax/blob/master/documentation/db_diagram.png)

One thing that isn't immediately evident from the diagram is the relationship between invoice and booking; even though there is a junction table between them (invoice_booking), the relationship is still one-to-many. The junction table has been chosen to avoid using NULLs; a booking is always created before its invoice, so using NULLs would have been inevitable without the junction table. This one-to-many relationship has been marked structurally in the database schema (by defining a UNIQUE constraint for booking_id in invoice_booking) as well as in the SQLAlchemy model (by using the [single_parent](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.single_parent) keyword argument).

The SQLAlchemy [cascade](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/cascades.html#unitofwork-cascades) keyword argument with value has been used in many relationships to facilitate records deletion; in these relationships, when a record is deleted, all records referencing it (via foreign key) are deleted automatically in the same session. Usually this has been adopted in the direction parent->children (one-to-many relationships), meaning that when a parent is deleted all its children are deleted automatically. Examples of this can be found in community->account, account->booking and resource->booking. In one case this construct has been used in the opposite direction (many-to-one), in the relationship booking->invoice. This follows the logic that if a booking is deleted, the invoice containing it isn't valid anymore (the total amount to be paid needs to be calculated again); so it makes sense to delete the invoice, which will also cause deletion of all the records in invoice_booking referencing it, meaning that all the bookings in the deleted invoice are "free" (orphan) once again, and can be put together to form a new invoice.

Some column (other than the principal key) have been indexed to speed up the queries; these are mostly foreign key columns, and some other column that can be used for filtering results, like account.username, invoice.paid or resource.type. Below you can find all CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements (all generated by SQLAlchemy).
